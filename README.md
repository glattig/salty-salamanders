# salty-salamanders

## Introduction
This repository contains all data (2016-2024) from _Breeding by The Sea: Coastal Vernal Pools in Acadia National Park as Breeding Habitat for Spotted Salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum)_, a long-term monitoring project that is focused on a population of Spotted Salamanders that breeds on an exposed, rocky headland by the Atlantic Ocean.

This population is noteworthy because while Spotted Salamanders typically breed in woodland vernal pools, this population breeds in a series of freshwater pools in a granite headland, so close to the ocean that the pools are occasionally flushed with full-strength seawater during stochastic storm events. Because Spotted Salamanders are amphibians with semi-permeable skin and are sensitive to osmoregulatory imbalance, this population’s exposure to higher salinity concentrations during the breeding season raises questions about their choice of breeding site, the survivorship of their offspring, and the potential existence of adaptations within this population to a more saline environment.

This project was initiated by Dr. Stephen Ressel in 2015 with efforts to quantify the environmental salinities that these salamanders were experiencing during the breeding season. The study site consists of 16 different breeding pools in which salamanders have been observed over the years, varying in size and depth as well as proximity to both the forest and the ocean. Our preliminary findings about the salinity characteristics of these breeding pools were recently published in the regional journal Northeastern Naturalist (Ressel et al. 2023, full citation below).

## Data
The dataset called "salamanders" compiles all observations of salamanders in numbered breeding pools at the study since from 2016-2024. Each row in the dataset represents an observation of a single salamander. The dataset has 2,307 rows and 15 variables. The variables include the date of each observation, as well as data about both the individual salamander and the environmental conditions of the breeding pool in which it was found.
