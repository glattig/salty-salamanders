## Load Packages and Data

```{r load-packages, include = FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("broom")
# install.packages("readr")
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("lubridate")

library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r add-observation-year-column}
salamanders %>% 
  mutate(date = format.Date(date, "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(format(date,'%y')))
```


## Data Exploration

```{r glimpse-pit-frequency}
salamanders %>%
  count(pit) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```


To date there have been 249 unique PIT tags deployed within the Otter Point population of salamanders. Below I ran some code to see which PIT tags, if any, had multiple years/colors associated with them. Out of 249 PIT tags, 46 are associated with more than one year (first year observed/marked)/color. 


## Sex 

```{r}
salamanders %>% 
  mutate(year = str_extract(date, {"/dddd"}))
```
